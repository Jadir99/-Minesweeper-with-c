    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board
        containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of
        neighboring mines in each field.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Dynamic grid creation based on user-selected difficulty.</li>
        <li>Random placement of mines within the grid.</li>
        <li>Clues indicating the number of neighboring mines.</li>
        <li>Flagging mechanism to mark potential mine locations.</li>
        <li>Recursive algorithm for revealing adjacent empty squares.</li>
        <li>Gameplay loop allowing players to interact with the grid until completion or detonation.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>How to Play</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Choose the difficulty level: easy, medium, or hard.</li>
        <li>The game will generate a grid with mines randomly placed.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Add a flag to mark potential mine locations.</li>

    </ol>
